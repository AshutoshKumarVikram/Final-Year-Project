# Final-Year-Project
Video processing and analysis
Objective
Recent events, such as terrorist attacks or the large-scale acts of banditry have led to an increase demand for security in societies. Video surveillance systems called smart are dealing with the real tile monitoring of mobile or immobile objects. The main objectives of these systems is to provide automatic interpretation of filmed scenes and to understand as well as to predict the actions and interactions of the objects observed. Video tracking helps us to map target objects in consecutive video frames, and since the demand of security in societies is growing it shall lead us to a need in surveillance application in many environments, particularly in the following domains:
1. Public safety and commercial sites: like supervising banks, shopping centers, airports, train stations, museums...etc.
2. Automated video surveillance: designed to monitor the movement in an area to identify moving objects.
3. Traffic monitoring: in case of breaks of traffic rules is monitored using cameras it will be tracked down easily.
4. Information extraction: like to count people in public spaces, establishment of consumer profiles in malls...etc.
5. Military Application: border surveillance, monitoring secure web sites...etc.
